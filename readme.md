# Stencil Component with dist-custom-element, noshadow mode

## Script alias

### npm run dev
`npm run dev`

Stencil component will build as `dist-custom-element` and re-bundle by webpack for this use case


## Main issue
There is a child component responsible for rendering a span element, and a parent component that draws a border with the `shadow` option set to false

When the parent component has shadow set to false, the child web component or HTMLElement will not be placed exactly where we want it.

The summarized environment where the issue occurs is as follows:

- **When using a Stencil component built with `dist-custom-element` and bundled, `only when the shadow: false` option is set.**
- The issue tends to occur in fewer instances when child components have more tasks, and it becomes more noticeable with a higher number of instances. If the project utilizes Chrome Dev Console, the occurrence is even more prominent.
- The issue is consistent across both stencil@2 and stencil@4.12.0 versions.
- **It consistently reproduces in the latest versions of Chrome and Edge on both macOS and Windows.**
- During testing, the problem was not observed in the latest versions of Safari and Firefox.
- The more slowly the domContentLoaded event occurs, the more slots load correctly.
- Placing the bundled JavaScript under the body results in proper rendering.
- Within the built core logic, specifically in markSlotContentForRelocation, during the processing of the parent component from the example, the number of childNodes retrieved corresponds only to the correctly positioned ones.

### Edit
- The problem is that the parent searches for the child nodes before Chrome browser finishes parsing the DOM.
- This problem also causes the child's life cycle to escape from that of the parent.

The way to solve this by avoiding the current symptoms is as follows. (Unfortunately, itâ€™s not a solution for me)

Any of the following cases will do.

- Simply move the main.js script file, which is executed in index.html, to below the body.
- Execute the main.js script file, which is run in index.html, with defer.
- Add an event in src/webpackWillBundleThis.js to execute defineCustomElements at the domContentLoaded timing.

As you can see here, some of the child components inserted into the slot of the parent component with shadow:false are rendered outside the border.
